## Profiling 1D autencoders in TensorRT with different normalization layers and precisions
Testing how normalization layers and inference precisions impact throughput across different TensorRT versions. If you have [`pinto`](https://github.com/ML4GW/pinto) installed, all you need to do is
```console
pinto run
```
